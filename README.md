üëì My Daily(Stand-up), üôåüèª Weekly(Sprints) and Workflow To-Do List. ‚òïÔ∏è


## About
Just like another day, I was surfing GitHub when I got this cool repo named [playbook](https://github.com/hyperoslo/playbook), I liked it so much and decided to create a repo similar this to organize my daily, weekly workflow.

So from right now I will organize my to-do list in Agile way.

It's hard to complete some task or to read out each and every links that we came across daily while surfing internet. It's hard because there are a million choices along the way, and because it never really ends. In a word, it's uncertain.

There are two ways to deal with that; to control it, or to accept it.

The natural thing to do is to control it, and it works really well if you can
predict the future. Otherwise it is futile, and you should not try.

The other way is to accept that it is uncertain and deal with it. That is to
accept that things will change along the way, and to make it as painless as
possible when they do.

That's called "agile", and that's what we choose to do.

## Agile

> * _Individuals and interactions_ over processes and tools
> * _Working software_ over comprehensive documentation
> * _Customer collaboration_ over contract negotiation
> * _Responding to change_ over following a plan
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items
> on the left more.
>

Our tasks vary in complexity and duration and so our workflow varies equally,
but there are some things that we will always do:

### Stories

Keep things simple so everyone can contribute, and that starts with
explaining things simply. When we decide what we're building, we describe it in
short stories that explain _who_, _what_ and _why_.

Good:

* As a _visitor_, I want to _log in with Facebook_ so that _people can see who
  I am_.

Bad:

* Implement Facebook Connect with the JavaScript SDK.

### [Stand-up](/StandUp.md)

Every day, we will list down what we're doing. We call it a _stand-up_.

We like to timebox stand-ups to 10 minutes where we ask these questions to ourselves:

* What did I do yesterday?
* What will I do today?
* Are there any impediments in my way?

### [Backlog](/Backlog.md)

We keep a list of the stories that we should do, and we call it the _backlog_.

### [Sprints](/Sprint.md)

Every week, we select the most important stories from the backlog to work/read on. We
call that a _sprint_.

#### [Sprint planning](/Sprint.md#sprint-planning)

At the beginning of each week, we plan a new sprint. At the end
of the Sprint planning, We should have committed to a week's worth of stories
to complete.

We like to timebox sprint plannings to 30 minutes with the following agenda:

* What I am doing next week?

#### [Sprint review](/Sprint.md#sprint-review)

At the end of each week, we'll review the sprint that we had and
to agree that the stories in it are in fact complete. At the end of the Sprint review,
the stories that were completed are [checked out](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and the ones that aren't go back
to the top of the backlog.

We like to timebox sprint reviews to 30 minutes with the following agenda:

* What did I do last week?

#### [Sprint retrospective](/Sprint.md#sprint-retrospective)

At the end of each week, we'll think about how we worked. This is how we get better.

We like to timebox sprint retrospectives to 15 minutes with the following
agenda:

* What should I start doing?
* What should I stop doing?
* What should I continue doing?

Thanks for taking time to read this! Now its time to get back to work on some cool awesome things.

P.S. ‚úåüèºLove you folks at [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperoslo).
